title: Pod Labels
sidebar_label: labels
---

The `labels` option expects a map with Kubernetes labels. 

By default, the component chart sets a couple of labels following the best practices described in the Kubernetes documentation:
- `app.kubernetes.io/name: devspace-app`
- `app.kubernetes.io/component: [DEPLOYMENT_NAME]`
- `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm`

:::note
You can specify additional labels using the `labels` option but the default / best practice labels will still be set for the component.
:::

All additional labels will be added to the pods of this component as well as to your Deployments or StatefulSets used to create the pods.

#### Default Value For `labels`
```yaml
labels: []
```

#### Example: Additional Labels
```yaml
containers:
- image: john/appbackend
labels:
  label1: label-value-1
  label1: label-value-2
```
