title: Configure Service
sidebar_label: service
---

In short, there is three things you need to know:

1. Containers in the same component will be started within a Kubernetes pod which allows these containers to communicate via `localhost`.
2. If you want containers to communicate across components (cluster-internal traffic), you need to define services for these components.
3. If you want to connect a domain to a service (external internet traffic), you need to [configure an ingress for this service](../configuration/ingress.mdx).


## `ports`
The `ports` option is mandatory and expects an array of port definitions.


### `port`
The `port` option is mandatory and expect an integer with a port number. The service will be available on this port.


### `targetPort`
The `targetPort` option is optional and tells the service to forward the traffic from the service port (defined in `port`) to a different `targetPort` of a pod.

#### Default for `targetPort`
```yaml
targetPort: [same as `port` option]
```


### `protocol`
The `protocol` option is optional and expects a string that defines the network protocol for this service port.

#### Default for `protocol`
```yaml
protocol: TCP
```


### `name`
The `name` option is optional and expects a string that defines the name for this service port (default is auto-generated).


## `type`
The `type` option is optional and expects a string that defines the type of the service.

#### Default for `type`
```yaml
type: ClusterIP
```


## `externalIPs`
The `externalIPs` option is optional and expects an array of IP addresses for the service.


## `name`
The `name` option is optional and expects a string that defines the name of the service.

#### Default for `name`
```yaml
name: [HELM_RELEASE_NAME]
```


## `labels`
The `labels` option is optional and expects an array of additional Kubernetes labels for the service.


## `annotations`
The `annotations` option is optional and expects an array of additional Kubernetes annotations for the service.
