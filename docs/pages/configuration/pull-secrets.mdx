The `pullSecrets` option expects an array of strings with names of Kubernetes secrets containing image registry authentification data.

Adding a secret name to `pullSecrets` will tell DevSpace to add the secret name as pullSecret to the Deployment or StatefulSet that will be created for this component.

#### Default Value For `pullSecrets`
```yaml
pullSecrets: []
```

#### Example: Custom Name for Headless Service
```yaml
containers:
- image: john/appbackend
pullSecrets:
- pull-secret-1
- pull-secret-2
```
